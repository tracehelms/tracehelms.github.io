    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer specializing in
      <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>. I like singing,
      playing guitar, and my dog Baron.
    </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I hold a Master of Computer Science (specialization in Software Engineering) from
      <a href="http://www.uwf.edu/" target="_blank">UWF</a> in Pensacola, FL and a Bachelor
      of Mechanical Engineering from
      <a href="http://www.usf.edu/" target="_blank">USF</a> in Tampa, FL.
    </p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      I currently work at <a href="http://corp.izea.com" target="_blank">IZEA</a> in The City
      Beautiful as full-time Software Engineer (Rails).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, I dabbled in WordPress and taught myself Rails for a small web development
      company. I made quite a few custom WordPress themes for clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even BEFORE that, I was a mechanical engineer that specialized in process automation. I
      helped design a lot of factory automation equipment, which I then got to help install
      and test. I even managed my own project, which totaled about $150,000.

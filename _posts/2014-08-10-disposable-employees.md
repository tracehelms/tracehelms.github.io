<blockquote>Train people like you want them to leave and treat them like you don't.</blockquote>

That was what my step-father said when I told him why I accepted a job at a new company.

Very prudent advice, but in an economy where employees can be a dime a dozen that advice apparently doesn't hit home with employers. Sure, there are always going to be jobs with a high turnover rate that are easy enough to train for, but for the most part keeping your existing employees means keeping hard to replace knowledge and expertise.

Think of your average employee's first week. How productive are they, truly? What about their first month? How long does it take to get them acclimated to your company's business needs, culture, or hell, even special lingo. How long does it take them to form bonds with their co-workers that help them become a great team?

I have to admit, I don't know how many companies actually treat their employees as disposable. Having been at one that does, however, was enough for me to realize why I'd never want to work at another one.

If I ever own a company, I'm going to train the hell out of my employees, treat them like they're family, pay them more than market value, and listen when they come telling me things that are hard to hear. It will probably be expensive, sure, but can you put a price on your company's life-blood not secretly wishing they were working somewhere else?

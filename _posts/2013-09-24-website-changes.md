Hello, world! I'm in the process of changing my website so please hang in there.
I'm switching from a WordPress based site to a Jekyll powered static site, so there is a bit of a 
learning curve to get it up and running. I hope to have it done soon though! Expect to see periodic
changes when coming here!

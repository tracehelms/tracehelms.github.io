I like having goals. I think it helps me keep what important in mind. Some of my goals for the rest of 2013 are:

* Finish graduate school with all A's.
* Finish this website.
* Lift heavy in the weightroom, specifically: 285lb deadlift, 225lb squat, 195lb bench, 125lb press, and pullups with +25lbs.

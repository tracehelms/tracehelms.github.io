<p>This was a passion project I started because I love music. The idea was for it to be a concert-finding service that catered to local musicians. When moving to Colorado, I found out there's not really a good way to learn about a city's local musicians. I wanted this site to be a way for people to discover talented artists local to them.</p>

<p>This project was written with <a href="http://phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a> and <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>. It was a great learning exeperience but I ultimately abandoned it.</p>

<p>This is a passion project I started because I love music. The idea is that it's a concert-finding service that caters to local musicians. When deciding where to move to (from Orlando), I found out there's really no good way to learn about a city's local musicians and concerts. I want this site to be a way for people to discover talented artists local to them.</p>

<p>Show Haven is being actively developed and has not been officially released yet. This project is written with <a href="http://phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a> and <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>.</p>

<p>This is a passion project I started because I love music. The idea is that it's an internet radio service that caters to local musicians. When deciding where to move to (from Orlando), I found out there's really no good way to learn about a cities local musicians. I want this site to be 1) a way for people to discover local talent by geography, and 2) a breeding ground for upcoming musicians to showcase their work.</p>

<p>This site is actively being developed and has not been officially released yet. At the time of writing, we had just started converting the application from a monolithic Rails app to a Rails API / Ember.js front end.</p>

<p>I hack on this project with <a href="http://robert-deluca.com" target="_blank">Robert DeLuca</a>.</p>

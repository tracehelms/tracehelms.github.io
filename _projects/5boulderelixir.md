<p>This is a meetup in Boulder, CO for everything <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>! I started this meetup because I think Elixir and Phoenix are the next Ruby and Rails. They bring a lot to the table. There wasn't much of a community around Elixir here so I decided to help create one!</p>

<p>This meetup takes place every second Tuesday of the month. There is a <a href="https://github.com/boulder-elixir">group GitHub page</a> where any slides and code will be posted. There is also a <em>#boulder</em> (and <em>#denver</em>) channel in the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack group</a>.</p>

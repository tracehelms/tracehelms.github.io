<p>I love learning and I love helping other people learn. That's why I started the Orlando Ruby Dojo.</p>

<p>The Orlando Ruby Dojo is a pair-programming group that holds events twice a month. Founded in December 2013, the Dojo has been going strong ever since.</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/orlandorubydojo" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> and our <a href="http://meetup.com/orlandorubydojo" target="_blank">Meetup page</a>.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> This Meetup was taken over when I moved to Colorado by <a href="https://twitter.com/ncarloscastillo" target="_blank">Nestor Castillo</a>, a very talented developer in Orlando.

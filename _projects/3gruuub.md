<p>I originally started this app as the subject of a speech I gave at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Gophers">Boulder Gophers</a> meetup. Picking a lunch spot can be hard, especially when you eat out a lot. Let gruuub do it for you!</p>

<p>Gruuub is written in Go. New unique combinations of <code>query</code> and <code>location</code> take some time because it's calling the Yelp API. After that though, the results are cached and the response-time is super fast.</p>

<p>This site is under active development. See the code <a href="https://github.com/tracehelms/gruuub">here</a>.</p>

    <p class="post-date">2015 May 5</p>
    <p>As my first sizable project in Go, I thought I would share my experiences on consuming an API with Go. This is a command line app that finds a random restaurant via Yelp's API.</p>
    <p>The repository for the project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tracehelms/golunch" target="_blank">https://github.com/tracehelms/golunch</a>.</p>
    <p>This talk was given at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Gophers" target="_blank">Boulder Gophers</a> Meetup group.</p>

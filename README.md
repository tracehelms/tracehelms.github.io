Yep, that's right. This is my website, it's internals all open for display.

Find it live at <http://tracehelms.com>.

### Getting It Working

#### Building The Site
Run `rake build`.

#### Serving The Site Locally
Run `jekyll serve`. Browse to `http://localhost:4000`.

### Future Plans For This Site
Failing to plan is planning to fail!  Here's what to expect:

* Add a rake task to deploy to Amazon S3
* Add a generator for new posts and pages
* Update the front page to look like a web site, have posts on other pages
* Add some style
* Add a page with current goals
* Add a page to keep a training log
* Add a page linking to pet code projects

### Technologies (thanks!)

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)
